		<h1>Madison Indiana</h1>
		<p style="margin-top: 20px"> The National Historic Landmark Madison Historic District is tucked away in limestone bluffs on the banks of the Ohio River in southern Indiana.</p>

		<p style="margin-top: 40px">Madison's downtown business district is one of the country's largest National Historic Landmark Districts. The more than 133 block historic district is the home of a superb and very large collection of historic buildings. Together they reflect nearly every period of the town's development between 1817 and 1939, ranging from Federal style and Greek Revival mansions to vernacular shotgun houses to institutional and industrial buildings and a vibrant Main Street commercial area lined with two and three story historic buildings. Travel America says, ''Madison is an outdoor museum of architecture.''</p> 

		<p style="margin-top: 40px">Visitors will enter a place that is still a compelling and lively embodiment of pre-World War II small town America. As a hotbed of antislavery activity and an important stop on the Underground Railroad before the Civil War, the historic district also brings alive the story of abolitionism and the flight of slaves from bondage to freedom and those who helped them escape. In Madison, free African Americans established a community with commercial enterprises and independent households.</p>

    		<p>Madison was laid out. It quickly established itself as a significant cultural and industrial town in the Old Northwest Territory. Waterfront factories drew commerce and wealth to the town, attracting settlers from the East Coast. Along with an entrepreneurial spirit, settlers brought to Madison architectural styles and cultural practices that flourished. Many historical buildings are preserved.</p>

    		<p>Indiana's first railroad, the Madison & Indianapolis Railroad, was built there from 1836 to 1847. The town became a lifeline for transportation and industry in the middle territories of the country.</p>

    		<p> More elaborate homes for wealthier individuals took on popular post-Civil War styles of Italianate and Gothic Revival architecture, inspired by the Pictureseque Movement from England. Many buildings along Main Street were either built in the Italianate style or had embellishments added later. The embellishments were typical of Italianate architecture, including large cornice bracketing and round-arched doors. </p>

    		<p> William Anderson formed the African Methodist Episcopal Church at 309 East Fifth Street in 1849. The building was a gathering place for the free African American community in Madison and a crucial first stop along the Underground Railroad in a free State. Madison continued to be an important center for African American life after the Civil War.</p>

    		<p> Increased stability after the war brought renewed industry, marked by the construction of factories and residences. One well-known factory still standing today is the Ben Schroeder Saddletree Factory at 106 Milton Street, which made wooden saddletrees for 94 years.</p>

    		<p> The U.S. Office of War Information recognized Madison's visual and emotional appeal by selecting the community as the subject of its 1945 film "The Town." The historic, picturesque, and friendly small town of Madison personified and demonstrated to the world the quality of life and American values that were so at stake in World War II for the United States.</p>

    		<p> Many new buildings were still being built, but in many cases older structures were modernized by adding cast-iron storefronts and ornamental sheet metal cornices. Some earlier buildings survived without major alterations, and the Madison National Landmark Historic District today contains examples of all the major architectural styles of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, from Federal to Art Moderne.</p>
